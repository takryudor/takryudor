## Hi there 👋

***takryudor/takryudor*** is a repository where I express my basic intentions to anyone who's interested in my work. Also check out some of my work! There aren't any at the time but surely enough I will put together some projects to improve myself on the Information Technology path, so stay tuned... 🙏

## Something about me... ✨
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a lot of deadlines and school work, finals is coming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ***Information Technology at the University of Science - VNUHCM***.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with _C++ fundamentals_ and etc.
- 📫 To contact me, email me at: **iamtrismihvn@gmail.com**
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him.
- ⚡ Fun fact: It is easier to just step right into any work than suffering on deciding what one needs to do.

*UPDATE SOON...
